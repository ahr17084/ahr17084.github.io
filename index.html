	<h1> All About Me </h1>
	<h2> Ellie </h2>
	<p> My full name is Anne Helen Ritter, but I go by <em> Ellie</em>. I am 19 years old and am from Birmingham, Alabama. I attend the <a href="https://www.uga.edu"> University of Georgia </a> in Athens, Georgia <i> (which is about 3.5 hours away from home)</i>. In my free time, I love to go to both the lake and the beach. I also love to watch many sports, such as volleyball <i>(I played all throughout high school)</i>, basketball, baseball and football.
	
	<h2> My Family </h2>
	<img src="FamilySelfie.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> <img src="FourKids.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p> I have three younger siblings, all of whom still live at home with my parents, Kristin and Bill. My brother, Dowd, is 17 years old and a senior in high school. He is playing baseball at the University of Alabama next year after he graduates. I have two sisters, named Lelia and Lucy. Lelia is 16 years old and Lucy is the baby of the family--she is 12 years old. 
	
	<h2> My Dogs </h2>

	<p> In addition to my parents and siblings, I have 2 dogs at home. Their names are Bennett <i>(age 5)</i> and Jack <i>(age 3)</i>. They are both Blenheim <i> (tan and white) </i> Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. I love having a big family and cannot wait to see them when I go home in two weeks for my brother's official signing to play at Alabama! </p>
